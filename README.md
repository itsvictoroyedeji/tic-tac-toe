# Victor's Tic Tac Toe
## A personal coding milestone

They say one of the questions they ask in some coding interviews is to build a Tic Tac Toe game...

...without a LLM code generator.

Well, here's my Tic Tac Toe game:

Thanks to The Odin Project for pushing me to do this. If there are bugs, I'll fix them one day. Maybe one day.
